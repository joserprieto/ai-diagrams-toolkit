Create a Mermaid sequence diagram for a user authentication flow with JWT tokens.

Requirements:
1. Include these participants:
   - User
   - Frontend
   - API Gateway
   - Auth Service
   - Database
2. Show this interaction flow:
   - User submits credentials
   - Frontend sends to API Gateway
   - API Gateway routes to Auth Service
   - Auth Service validates with Database
   - On success: Generate JWT, return token
   - On failure: Return error
3. Use proper sequence diagram syntax
4. Include activation boxes where appropriate
5. Add notes to explain critical steps (like JWT generation)

Output ONLY the complete Mermaid sequence diagram code, nothing else.
