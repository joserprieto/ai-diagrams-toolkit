Create a Mermaid flowchart diagram for an API request validation system.

Requirements:
1. Use semantic node names (no A, B, C - use descriptive names)
2. Include these steps:
   - Start: Receive API Request
   - Validation: Check API Key
   - Decision: Valid/Invalid paths
   - Processing: Execute Business Logic
   - Storage: Save to Database
   - Response: Return Success/Error
3. Use proper Mermaid syntax (flowchart TD)
4. Include arrows with labels where appropriate

Output ONLY the complete Mermaid diagram code, nothing else.
